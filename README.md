# 🫀 Heart Risk Chatbot: Cardiovascular Health Assistant

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our **Cardiovascular Chatbot**! This project integrates a chatbot that answers basic queries related to heart health and includes a prediction model to assess your risk of heart disease.

---

## 📌 Key Features

### 💬 Chatbot Functionality
- Answers basic queries related to cardiovascular health using **TF-IDF** and **cosine similarity** for relevance.

### 🩺 Heart Disease Prediction
- Utilizes a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict the risk of heart disease based on user input data.

### 🖥️ User-Friendly UI
- Implemented with **Streamlit** for easy interaction and visualization.

### 🔁 Feedback Loop
- Enhances data over time with user feedback to improve response accuracy.

### 📊 Data Handling
- Utilizes **NumPy** and **Pandas** for efficient CSV data access and manipulation.
